# to-do-list
Basic To-do list APP

I created this to-do list APP to practice basic concepts in JavaScript using the DOM.

I intend to use Jquery to reduce the lines of code of JS, as create and define attributes for elements are much simpler using Jquery, as well as I will try to use some framework to improve the design.

For now, I'm just happy to be able to make this application work properly.
